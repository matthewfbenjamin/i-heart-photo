## How to run
1. Open project in terminal
2. run command `npm i`
3. run command `npm start`
    - This will start a local packager and you can choose to run on either iPhone or Android (note this was tested on a simulator of iPhone 8 and iPhone XS)

## If I had more time
If I had more time there are a handful of bugs I would look into.
1. On swipe the picture takes a little to load. I'm under the impression this is due to a caching issue. 
2. I would persist the state so that the likes and unlikes persisted
3. I would add more of an animation to show that you obviously liked or disliked something (UX upgrades)
